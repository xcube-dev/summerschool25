It's long, detailed,   technical, and not recommended for reading all the way through, but it's   the official reference if you ever want to look up some technical detail.</li> <li>Earth Observation Application Package resources at   eoap.github.io, a collection of hands-on   Application Package tutorials. A much friendlier introduction than the   official definition document!</li> <li>The Common Workflow Language (CWL) user   guide introduces the language   used to write Application Package definitions.</li> <li>A docker tutorial for beginners.   Application Packages rely on Docker container images to package their code.   This tutorial is a good starting point if you haven't worked with Docker   before.</li> <li>The xcengine documentation and   GitHub repository. xcengine   currently has limited documentation, but if you're curious you can   install it from the repository and try out one of the examples.</li> <li>The xcube documentation. We won't be   using xcube extensively during the course, but we'll run an xcube   server and viewer from a generated docker image.</li> <li>The xcube Viewer documentation   and the public xcube Viewer demo.   In the course we'll start an xcube Viewer from a docker image, but we   won't do any serious work in the Viewer. Nevertheless, you might want   to try it out in advance.</li> </ul>"}]}
