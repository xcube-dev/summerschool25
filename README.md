# Application Packages in the xcube ecosystem

Welcome to the Summer School 2025 course on xcube and Application Packages!
To get started with the course materials:

If you don't already have conda or mamba installed, go to
<https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html>
and follow the instructions to install mamba.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing this readme.

Run the commands

```
mamba env create
mamba activate summerschool25
jupyter-lab summerschool25
```

(If you're using conda rather than mamba, substitute `conda` for `mamba`
in the commands above.)

Jupyter Lab will come up in your web browser. Open the notebook
`summerschool25.ipynb` and continue from there!
